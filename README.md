Main Content:
Close your eyes. The sheet drops into the developer, and the image starts taking shape. You'll see it soon, perhaps never unseeing it.​

Melkweg is more than just a persona, or a project. It's as instinctual as moving a limb. And, it's constantly evolving into a tender conclusion – one of conscious creativity, nay, creation.

This is not to say that the things which reside outside of it aren't in some way. This, well, is just my ephemeral musings around the sun, a life spent telling stories using vision and sight as a proverbial pen.

I have worked on sets far and near, simple and yet elaborate, for over ten years. Yet, always finding myself pulled by forces, above and below, towards this intentionality.

The optic nerve in our eye – rizai (roots) – is compared to roots in ancient Greek mythology. Then, how amusing that I should relate, one tiny spectacle awaiting creativity to bloom, firmly rooted in visual utterances, but with eyes glued to the milky way.

## Packages

Forget the pace, lose the box. The form is what you want it to be here.

This much is true – you can't put your brand, your needs, your story, in a box. It's not a list. It's more.
So, even though you'll find one or two specific packages here, there is more than meets the eye. This is but a first blink.
On the road, seeking intentionality and impactful, small scale makings, I find what you need, and we start there.

We can find your voice, together. It's a movement toward slow art, 
direction, styling, conceptualisation and whatever else we find 
during the process.
